## List of currently implemented (and planned) Webcord's features

Because WebCord is based on Discord Website and (unlike official client and
client mods) does not use any of the Discord's propertiary Node.js C++ native
modules nor fake itself as an official Discord client (but rather as a Chromium
browser), it has similar features and limitations like Discord Web application.
However, WebCord client is capable of doing some tweaks to it, implementing
following list of the features:

describes a feature that is not on the list, you may consider opening a
**feature request**. If some of the implemented app's features are missing
there, feel free to inform me about that in the *Issues* or *Discussions*. If
you are talented enough, you could also implement them yourself and do a Pull

### State legend:
 
 - ‚ùåÔ∏è **TODO** ‚Äì this feature **may** or **may not** be implemented in the future.

   be implemented soon, even if it is ever planned to be done.

-  ‚ö†Ô∏è **Will do** ‚Äì there's nothing implemented in code about this feature, but it
   is planned as a next feature to be worked on.

   it's still far from being finished.
 
 - Ô∏è2Ô∏è‚É£Ô∏è ***Beta*** ‚Äì this feature has been mostly implemented, but it still needs
   to be polished before being marked as *done*. This indicates that this

### Experimental features

Here are some notes about the features that are still not visibly implemented
and are far from being called *user-friendly*. Things are meant here to be
broken, so don't expect you will be able to use them as you intent to.

#### 1. Custom Discord Styles

From version `3.0.0`, WebCord is capable of styling Discord pages, yet the
implementation is still very limited and most of existing themes are not
functional yet.

You can apply themes by creating a file in `{userData}/Themes/{theme name}/index.css`
as for now.

#### 2. Chromium Extensions

From version `3.0.0`, an experimenal Chromium extensions support has been
implemented using Electron's [Chrome Extension Support][chrome-ext]. As Electron's
implementation of Chromium extensions is far from the one in Chromium, a lot of
the extensions may not be fully functional or not work at all.

You can load Chromium extensions by extracting them from `.crx` archive to
`{userData}/Extensions/Chromium/{extension name}/` folder.
