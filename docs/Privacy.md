## Privacy Policy
This software **does not** share any data to its owner/maintainers â€“ user configuration, session details and cookies are saved locally. However because this software connects to [Discord website](https://discord.com/app), it is expected that the user accepts [Discord's Privacy Policy](https://discord.com/privacy) when using this application and registering/logging in to the service.

In the future following application may ask the user if he want to report an issue on GitHub when the crash occurs. This feature, however, won't automatically send any details without user permission.
