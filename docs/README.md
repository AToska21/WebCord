A Discord Web App based on the [Electron](https://github.com/electron/electron) engine, enchanced with the [Electron Forge](https://github.com/electron-userland/electron-forge).

It is completely indpenendent from [Discord-Electron](https://github.com/GyozaGuy/Discord-Electron), but I used it to learn why my previous attempts of doing electron discord app have failed – so I really apprieciate that someone wrote that code. I've previously forked his work, but right now I've made a seperate one – this fixed some issues that the fork had and overall improved multiple things a lot.
