A Discord web-based client made with the [Electron API][electron], developed
with [Electron Forge][electron-forge].

The main reason of the WebCord existence was previously creating a usable ARM
alternative, but nowadays it's developement is more around making it *more open*
alternative to WebCord, which would be both customizable and improving in some
aspects like the security and privacy. As for now, some tweaks around the
privacy has been implemented:
  - blocking third-party websites via customizable CSP.
  - blocking unnecesary services and tracers with custom CSP, like [Sentry][sentry].
  
Please note many features I have plans for hasn't been still implemented yet â€“
you can find more about that [in the official documentation](Features.md).

WebCord takes a differend approach from most clients, as it isn't just a mod of
the official client nor does it use the Discord API to be functional â€“ it is
currently based on the web version of the Discord, which makes it more trusted
solution in my opinion. As it even fakes the user agent to make it equal or
similar to the one used by Chrome/Chromium, it is hard to detect it and block
users from using it.

It began as a fork of the [Discord-Electron][discord-electron], but then
eventually I had rewritten it as *Electron Discord Web App* project, which is
currently called *WebCord* (to make that horribly long name a bit shorter ðŸ˜‰).
However, because [@GyozaGuy](https://github.com/GyozaGuy) made his own project,
I learnt much about Electron and how to implement a Discord client with it by
analyzing his code. Thanks to his work, this project could begin on its own.
