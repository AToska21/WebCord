## Information about supported platforms

### GNU/Linux

This is the current platform that I'm developing my application for.
It is fully supported by me, no matter for what architecture or on what
Linux distribution you're installing my application – both ARM and X86 computers
are supported. Please note that Electron deprecates the 32-bit X86 architecture,
so the support for it may be dropped by me as well.

### Windows and MacOS

These two platfroms aren't officially supported yet – you may expect I won't fix
all of the issues that are specific to this platforms only. I may release
binaries for these platforms as well, but don't expect they're going to be
supported by me – if any issue that is specific to the one of these platform is
started on the project's
[GitHub repository](https://github.com/SpacingBat3/WebCord), it might be closed
and/or flagged as `wontfix` without any explaination or answer.
