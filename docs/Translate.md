## How to translate?

- fork this project,

- clone (download) it to your computer,

- create new folder for your translation (check
  [electron docs](https://www.electronjs.org/docs/api/locales) for list of
  possible codes – names of the folders),

- copy the lang strings you want to translate from (mostly
  [soures/assets/en-GB/strings.jsonc](../sources/assets/en-GB/strings.jsonc)) to
  the dir with code name of your language you want to translate to,

- translate strings, using any application for translating JSON files or any
  text editor (if you know the JSON syntax).

- publish the strings to your GitHub fork,

- do a Pull Request (here's
  [random youtube tutorial](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dSl_qnWO104)
  how to do that),

- you're done! You're safe now to remove your WebCord fork if you want to.
